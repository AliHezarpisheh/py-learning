In data structures, lists are a fundamental concept used to store collections
of elements. There are several variations of lists, including singly linked lists,
doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. Let's explore each of them:

### Singly Linked List:
A singly linked list consists of a sequence of nodes. Each node contains two parts:
the data part, which holds the element, and a reference (or link) to the next node in
the sequence. The last node typically points to null, indicating the end of the list.
In a singly linked list, you can traverse the list only in one direction, starting from
the head node.

### Doubly Linked List:
A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list, but each node contains two
references: one to the next node and one to the previous node. This allows for traversal
in both forward and backward directions.
In a doubly linked list, you can traverse the list in both forward and backward
directions, starting from either the head or the tail.

### Circular Linked List:
In a circular linked list, the last node's reference points back to the first node,
forming a circular structure. This means there is no null reference at the end of the
list. Circular linked lists can be either singly or doubly linked.

In a circular linked list, you can traverse the list endlessly in one direction,
starting from any node.

These are the basic concepts of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists in
data structures. Each type has its own advantages and use cases, depending on the
requirements of the application.
