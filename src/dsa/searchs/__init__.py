"""
Search algorithms are methods for finding an item or items with specific properties 
within a collection of data. Common algorithms include:
- Linear Search: Iteratively checks each item until a match is found.
- Binary Search: Requires sorted data and halves the search space with each comparison.
- Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all neighbors at the present depth level before
                              moving on.
- A* Search: Uses heuristics to efficiently find the shortest path in weighted graphs.
