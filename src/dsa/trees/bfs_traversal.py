"""
BFS traverses a binary tree level by level. It starts at the root and explores all the
nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

How it works:

Initialization: Begin at the root node.
Queue: Use a queue to keep track of nodes. Initially, enqueue the root node.
Traversal:
Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
Visit this node (process it according to your needs).
Enqueue the node's children (first the left child, then the right child) to the queue.
Repeat the above steps until the queue is empty.

Characteristics:

Level-order: BFS is also called level-order traversal because it processes nodes level
by level. Space Complexity: It requires more memory compared to DFS because it stores
all the nodes at a given level. For a complete binary tree, the space complexity can go
up to O(n/2) â‰ˆ O(n) where n is the number of nodes. Application: BFS is useful when the
shortest path is needed (like in unweighted graphs) and for systems that need to process
nodes level by level.
